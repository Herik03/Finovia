# Code Analysis Summary

## Overview of Work Done

In response to the requests to analyze code lines in the project, the following work was completed:

1. **Initial Analysis**: Counted all lines of code in the project, broken down by file type and author attribution.
2. **Focused Analysis**: Created a specialized script to count only lines with author attribution.
3. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation in both English and German.

## Scripts Created

### 1. count_lines.ps1 (Original)
This PowerShell script counts all lines of code in the project and attempts to attribute them to authors using Git blame. It provides a comprehensive view of the entire codebase.

### 2. count_authors_only.ps1 (New)
This specialized script focuses specifically on counting only lines that have author attribution through Git blame. It addresses the specific request to "count all lines where an author is specified" ("rechne alle zeilen zusammen wo ein author beisteht").

## Key Findings

### Total Lines in Project
- **Total Lines**: 589,569
- **Largest File Type**: JavaScript (582,329 lines, 98.77%)
- **Java Code**: 4,323 lines (0.73%)

### Lines with Author Attribution
- **Total Lines with Author**: 5,004
- **Percentage of Total**: Only 0.85% of all lines have author attribution
- **Largest Attributed File Type**: Java (4,323 lines, 86.39%)
- **Top Author**: Henrik (1,838 lines, 36.73%)

### Author Breakdown
| Author       | Lines | Percentage |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Henrik      | 1,838  | 36.73%      |
| BenHuebert  | 1,553  | 31.04%      |
| soeren-h    | 711    | 14.21%      |
| Jan         | 693    | 13.85%      |
| Guevercin   | 207    | 4.14%       |
| Sören Heß   | 2      | 0.04%       |

## Observations

1. **JavaScript Files**: The vast majority of code (98.77%) is in JavaScript files, but none of these lines have author attribution. This suggests these files are likely generated or third-party code.

2. **Author Attribution**: Only a small fraction (0.85%) of all code lines have author attribution. This is common in projects that include generated code, libraries, or third-party dependencies.

3. **Java Code**: Almost all Java code (100%) has author attribution, indicating that this is the primary language for custom development in the project.

## Documentation Created

1. **code_analysis_readme.md** - English documentation of the full analysis
2. **code_analysis_readme_de.md** - German documentation of the full analysis
3. **author_lines_summary.md** - Focused summary of lines with author attribution (in German)
4. **code_analysis_summary.md** - This summary document

## How to Run the Analysis

To count all lines in the project:
```powershell
.\count_lines.ps1
```

To count only lines with author attribution:
```powershell
.\count_authors_only.ps1
```
